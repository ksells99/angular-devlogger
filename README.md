# Devlogger

First Angular application created using Traversy Media's 'Angular Front to Back' Udemy course.

The app is a ticket logger which incorporates local storage in order to store the logs. I have expanded on the initial functionality from the Udemy course by adding the option of marking tickets as completed (with style changes as a result), along with various styling improvements.

The app is hosted on Github Pages here: **https://ksells99.github.io/angular-devlogger/**
